Representation of operators, hamiltonian and otherwise, in pySCF fci friendly
form, i.e. as numpy arrays

pyscf formalism:
- h1e_pq = (p|h|q) p,q spatial orbitals
- h2e_pqrs = (pq|h|rs) chemists notation, <pr|h|qs> physicists notation
- all direct_x solvers assume 4fold symmetry from sum_{pqrs} (don't need to do manually)
- 1/2 out front all 2e terms, so contributions are written as 1/2(2*actual ham term)
- hermicity: h_pqrs = h_qpsr can absorb factor of 1/2

pyscf/fci module:
- configuration interaction solvers of form fci.direct_x.FCI()
- diagonalize 2nd quant hamiltonians via the .kernel() method
- .kernel takes (1e hamiltonian, 2e hamiltonian, # spacial orbs, (# alpha e's, # beta e's))
- direct_nosym assumes only h_pqrs = h_rspq (switch r1, r2 in coulomb integral)
- direct_spin1 assumes h_pqrs = h_qprs = h_pqsr = h_qpsr
